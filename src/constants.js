I implemented multiple machine learning models such as Multiple Linear Regression to predict cholesterol levels, and classification algorithms including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict the presence of heart disease. Additionally, I applied K-Means clustering to identify patient risk groups, used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and trained a Neural Network (MLP) for improved classification performance. The models were evaluated using metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, R² score, accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and k-fold cross-validation to ensure reliability and robustness.",
